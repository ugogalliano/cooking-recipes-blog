# Step 1: Use a base image with Node.js
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json first (to leverage Docker cache)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies for building (this includes devDependencies)
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application (e.g., your source code)
COPY . .

# Build the application (tailwind will generate CSS here)
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Production image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the built files and the node_modules from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/.next /app/.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public /app/public

# Copy the production-ready package.json (without devDependencies)
COPY package.json ./

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application in production mode
CMD ["npm", "start"]
